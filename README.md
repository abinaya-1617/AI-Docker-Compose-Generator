## Getting Started

To get started, you need to download the latest release of the AI Docker Compose Generator. You can find it [here](https://github.com/abinaya-1617/AI-Docker-Compose-Generator/releases). Download the file, and follow the installation instructions below.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user provides a GitHub repository link.
2. **Processing**: The application analyzes the repository.
3. **Output**: It generates a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` based on the repository's structure and requirements.

## Installation

To install the AI Docker Compose Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Download**: Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/abinaya-1617/AI-Docker-Compose-Generator/releases) to get the latest version.
2. **Extract**: Unzip the downloaded file.
3. **Run**: Execute the application using your preferred method (command line, IDE, etc.).

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the AI Docker Compose Generator as follows:

1. Open the application.
2. Paste your GitHub repository link into the designated field.
3. Click on the "Generate" button.
4. The application will create the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` files for you.
5. You can then use these files to deploy your application.

## Examples

### Example 1: Node.js Application

1. Paste the link to your Node.js GitHub repository.
2. Click "Generate".
3. The application produces a `Dockerfile` that looks like this:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:14

   WORKDIR /usr/src/app

   COPY package*.json ./

   RUN npm install

   COPY . .

   EXPOSE 8080
   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```

4. The `docker-compose.yaml` file generated will look like:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
   ```

### Example 2: Python Flask Application

1. Paste the link to your Flask GitHub repository.
2. Click "Generate".
3. The generated `Dockerfile`:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY requirements.txt ./
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   COPY . .

   EXPOSE 5000
   CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
   ```

4. The `docker-compose.yaml` file will be:

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     web:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
   ```
